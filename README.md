Nice to meet you. My name is Ryobi. I am a solo game developer.
The game is based on a picture book written by my younger brother. My initial goal was to get it to the stage where he could create levels without any coding knowledge, like Mario Maker, for him, but he got bored of creating, so I left it alone...
Just about two weeks ago, something happened that made me start creating again. I knew far more than I did back then, so I overestimated that I would have no problem completing and posting it. However...

And now that I've made a list of the things that haven't been implemented yet, I've realized that it will be a long time before it's complete. What a shame...

But there's no way I'm going to give up on the production. This may be a common thing for creators, but I've grown attached to something that was just a means to an end.
In particular, I can't stop myself from operating the game more than necessary while debugging, or doodling the game's main character while writing on paper.

I think I've had more time to think about the popular 2D action games I used to play, and to think about what kind of ingenuity I can make to devote to my favorite game.

It's a matter of counting your chickens before they hatch, but it's fun to fantasize. In that fun fantasy, my game is causing a stir in the industry as the greatest masterpiece of all time...

I may not sacrifice my daily life for more than a week, but I will definitely make KaguoHomeRun a complete version (or will continue to work on it for at least the next 10 weeks).
Because it's a rare opportunity to realize how little I can do right away...

So, if you've read this Read Me to the end, please follow the official Twitter account linked in my profile! I may post development progress from time to time!
